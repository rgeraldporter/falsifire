# ðŸ”¥FalsifireðŸ”¥

### Falsifiable unit tests in Javascript

### NOTE: This is in early stages. Don't use this yet!

### Premise

Ever wanted to ensure your unit tests can actually fail?

This is an experiment in development to see if it's possible. The test methodology will involve specifying along both "passing" and "failing" values, and the test suite will then use both sets and expect that all the passing ones pass the test, and that all the failing ones fail. Without both occurring, the test overall fails.

This could improve upon traditional TDD methods of "fail first", as there is always the possibility later for the test framework or other critical component of the test to mutate and quietly become unfalsifiable. In traditional TDD, the test is only checked for falsifiability when it is first written, and may never see the conditions of a failing state again. Think of this as a regular fire drill for your tests.

## Development

Source is written in TypeScript. Run tests via `npm run test`.
